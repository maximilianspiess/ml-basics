# ml-basics

This repository is for me to keep track of my progress while learning the basics of machine learning with Python. The material covered in this repository is based on a video tutorial that I found on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_LwzRVP7bg&t=4768s).

## Contents

The repository contains a notes.md file that I can use to keep track of my learning progress. I can update this file with notes, code snippets, and any other useful information that I find while going through the tutorial.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with the tutorial, I should have basic knowledge of Python programming language. It is also recommended that I have some understanding of mathematical concepts such as linear algebra, calculus, and statistics.

I will also need to have the following libraries installed on my system:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

Feel free to reach out to me directly if you have any questions or comments.
